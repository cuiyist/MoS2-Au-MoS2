# MoS2-Au-MoS2

Epitaxy represents the situation when one crystalline material grows on a single crystal of another with exact crystallographic registry. Here we expand the concept of epitaxy to a new regime of “twisted epitaxy” with the epilayer crystal orientation between two substrates influenced by their relative orientation. We demonstrate the twisted epitaxy concept by annealing nanometer thick gold (Au) nanoparticles between two substrates of exfoliated hexagonal molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) with varying orientation of their basal planes with a mutual twist angle from 0o to 60o. Transmission electron microscopy studies show that Au aligns mid-way between the top and bottom MoS2 when the twist angle of the bilayer is small (< ~7o). For larger twist angles, Au aligns close to the bottom MoS2, with a small misorientation varying approximately sinusoidally with twist angle of the bilayer MoS2. Four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy analysis further reveals a periodic strain variation (< |±0.5%|) in the Au nanodiscs associated with the twisted epitaxy, consistent with the Moiré registry of the two MoS2 twisted layers. Density functional theory calculations of the MoS2-Au interface energies provide additional support for the experimental observations and suggest possible significant influence on physical and chemical properties.
